Simple UTVPI (Unit Two Variable Per Inequality) theory solver for Z3 along with
report surveying DL (Difference Logic) and UTVPI in SMT solvers. The theory
solver is mainly based on the paper "An Efficient Decision Procedure for UTVPI
Constraints" by Lahiri and Musuvathi.

The report and implementation has been done as the final project for the course
"Advanced Analysis Techniques" at the Technical University of Denmark:
